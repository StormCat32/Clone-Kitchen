Pre Jam Ideas
-Hopefully A puzzle/turn based tile game
-Calming Music
-DO NOT MAKE A SHOOTER
-Scope SMALL (big is hard and leaves unpolished)
-All main mechanics should be done by day one
-Sleep and look after yourself as you go

Stuck In a Loop
-Play the same level over and over again
-Make some kind of action, which is performed over and over
-Repeating loop where previous versions of yourself are also in the level
-Puzzle game where you must get to objective/do thing but time keeps repeating
	-Either previous versions, or things you acn change through loops
-Music-synced looping
-Create time loops in level, which affect enemies/components but not player

Actual Idea
-Clone creating loop game
-Cooking game/platformer
-Create food from ingredients, sound it out get money etc.
-As game progresses more and more clones will be trying to move stuff, and more customers will be ordering
